# Emotion Recognition Through CNN

By: Aurelius Justin Lim

This project is a work in progress wherein I am to create a CNN model that accurately distinguishes between the emotions of anger, sadness, and happiness a photo of a person. Ultimately, the model is integrated into an application that allows the user to upload any portrait and have the model identify between the 3 emotional states.
