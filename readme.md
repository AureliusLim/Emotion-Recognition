# Emotion Recognition Through CNN

By: Aurelius Justin Lim

This project features a CNN model that distinguishes between the emotions of anger, sadness, and happiness a photo of a person. Ultimately, the model is integrated into an application that allows the user to upload any portrait and have the model identify between the 3 emotional states. Due to limitations on the data and the model, the model does not have a high accuracy.

## Setup

1) Begin by running the Jupyter Notebook `Convoluted-Neural-Network.ipynb` to create and train the CNN model
2) Start the flask server by running `server.py`
3) Navigate to `/frontend`
4) Start the react app via `npm start`
